# simple-cleaning
A simple function to clean a messy list.

I decided to design a function that would easily extract the necessary information, so either words or number, from the items of a given list. The reasoning behind it is that once I have encountered variables named such as 'fc bayerng modrich.12-05-2012' and it was quite a nightmate - enough of a motivation to build a tool.
